### Added

- Added entities to support the Control All Zones setting on the Actron Que.
- Sets Control All Zones to True automatically when the master unit temperature is adjusted.
 
### Removed

- Removing support for i386 and armhf architectures as they are no longer supported by Microsoft (.NET). The previous versions of the add-on will continue to work, however they will no longer receive updates.

## [v2023.11.1] - 2023-11-10

### Added

- Added a new configuration option to enable the new HVAC/Climate options in HA 2023.9 (setting the target heating and cooling temperatures independently).

### Changed

### Changed

- Upgraded base images.

## [v2023.1.1] - 2023-01-09

### Changed

- Downgraded the base image used for Armv8 (aarch64), as the latest image failed randomly on Raspberry Pi devices.

## [v2023.1.0] - 2023-01-04

### Added

- Added support for multiple AC units controlled by a single Que controller.

### Changed

- The MQTT topics have been changed to accomodate multiple AC units.
- The device created in HA has been updated with additional AC specific information - this may impact device and entity identifiers as a result of now supporting multiple AC units.

## [v2022.10.3] - 2022-10-17

### Added

- Added logic to regenerate the pairing token and device identication files when the email address changes.

## [v2022.8.0] - 2022-08-09

### Added

- Added additional HA attributes to battery entities.
- Added battery entities to PerZoneControls (already in PerZoneSensors).

### Changed

- Fix for Neo Systems that don't generate Actron Events.

## [v2022.5.0] - 2022-05-30

### Changed

- Added additional logic to support non-contiguous zones.

## [v2022.2.3] - 2022-02-09

### Changed

- Rounded per zone temperature to one decimal place.
- Aligned per sensor temperature entities' units to climate entities.

## [v2022.2.2] - 2022-02-08

### Changed

- Fixed per sensor temperature entity being incorrectly shown as a percentage.

## [v2022.2.1] - 2022-02-07

### Added

- Added support for zones with multiple sensors.

### Changed

- Changed per zone battery to per sensor battery to better reflect the data model from Actron. Use the PerZoneSensors option to create the entities in HA.

### Removed

- Removed per zone humidity sensors - the zone sensors don't measure humidity, even though they sometimes report a value.

## [v2022.2.0] - 2022-02-01

### Changed

- Fix for Neo systems.
- Update to MQTT library.

## [v2022.1.4] - 2022-01-29

### Changed

- Fix for systems with less than 8 zones.

## [v2022.1.3] - 2022-01-28

### Changed

- Code efficiency updates.
- Reduction in MQTT updates - updating changed items rather than all items.

## [v2022.1.2] - 2022-01-27

### Added

## [v2021.12.1] - 2021-12-07

### Added
- Added logic to support Neo Air Conditioners that do not record change events. In this mode, the add-on will pull a full status update every 30 seconds as there aren't incremental updates available.

## [v2021.12.0] - 2021-12-02

### Changed
- Migrated from .NET 5.0 to .NET 6.0.

### Changed
- New entities for power, outdoor temperature and compressor capacity removed in Neo mode.

## [v0.29] - 2021-09-20

### Added
- Setting the AC to auto mode will now set the heating and cooling temperatures to the single desired temperature.

## [v0.28] - 2021-09-04

### Added

- The compressor capacity reading from the Master Controller is now presented as an entity.

### Changed
- Moved to .NET 5.0 host model.

## [v0.23] - 2021-02-14

### Changed
- Fixed a bug with temperature updates for the Neo system.

## [v0.21] - 2021-02-12

### Added
- Initial support for the Actron Neo module.
- New configuration item SystemType for specifying que or neo system types - defaulting to que for backward compatibility.
